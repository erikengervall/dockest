## [2.0.0-beta.2] - 2019-02-12

### Changed

- Adopted RxJS to listen in on docker events, greatly improving the responsiveness and sturdiness of all checks [#136](https://github.com/erikengervall/dockest/pull/136)
- Support function as a command with containerId as argument [#133](https://github.com/erikengervall/dockest/pull/133)

## [2.0.0-beta.1] - 2019-02-01

### Added

- Expose sleepWithLog
- Move chalk to dependencies

### Changed

- Bump dependencies throughout the repo
- Internals: Introduce a Mutables field that contains mutable fields, e.g. runners

## [2.0.0-beta.0] - 2019-01-24

### Added

- Added the option to pass `dependent` Dockest Services to Dockest Services. Essentially creating a more robust `depends_on`
- Added Dockest options for forwarding compose CLI options for `docker-compose <opts> up`. E.g. `--build` or `--force-recreate`

### Changed

- Changed Dockest Services `healthchecks` prop to a `healthcheck` prop. Instead of passing an array of functions, simply implement a single healthcheck function that'll be called recursively until successful or times out. The `healthcheck` function is also fed default healthcheck functions.
- Made documentation more verbose and descriptive

## [2.0.0-alpha.3] - 2019-12-18

### Added

- GitHub Actions: Pipeline automation for npm & website releases
- Drop pipeline support for Node.js 8.x due to its [EOL end of 2019](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/)

### Removed

- Travis pipeline, relying solely on GitHub Actions

## [2.0.0-alpha.2] - 2019-12-14

### Added

- Introduced `DockestServices`, servicing as the interface for users to specify which services to spin up during testing
- Introduced custom healthcheck that can be passed along with the `DockestServices`

### Removed

- Removed `typedoc`
- Removed `attachRunners`

### Changed

- Moved concept of `Runners` from a public interface to an internal one

## [2.0.0-alpha.1] - 2019-10-24

### Added

- Introduced monorepo structure using yarn workspaces and lerna
- Use compose CLI for merging compose files #82
- Allow containers to connect to host machine/dockest inside container support #91

### Changed

- Broke out runners from Dockest constructor and introduced `attachRunners` method
- Started moving towards relying heavier on compose files rather than supplying runners that'll generate compose files

## [1.0.3] - 2019-08-30

### Added

- New logo ðŸŽ‰ #69
- Supports services being referenced as a dependency multiple times #68

### Fixed

## [1.0.0] - 2019-07-22

### Added

- KafkaRunner #55
- ZooKeeperRunner #55
- PostgresRunner

### Changed

- Improvements to Dockest's interface (breaking change)
- Improved logging structure
- Improved test coverage
- Added `typedoc` for automatic documentation generation
- Migrated from `docker-compose run` to `docker-compose up` due to limitation in network accessibility between services (I'm looking at you Kafka & ZooKeeper)
