## Requirements

First things first: Dockest has a few mandatory requirements in order to work.

- Dockest uses Jest's programmatic CLI and requires Jest **v20.0.0** or newer to work
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (_"On desktop systems like Docker Desktop for Mac and Windows, Docker Compose is included as part of those desktop installs."_)
